                <h3 class="orange-color">2019- Present</h3>
                <p>

                    I have worked as a professional mediator since 2019. I have successfully mediated hundreds of
                    disputes,
                    in-person and online. Over 2-3 of the disputes, I mediate result in the parties signing a settlement
                    agreement.
                    Most of the disputes I mediate are of a civil/commercial in nature. All involve relationship issues,
                    business and personal. I am very comfortable working with others who are supporting the parties in
                    dispute, e.g., lawyers, supervisors, agents, family, friends.
